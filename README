IoT Gateway Support for i.MX BSP on Yocto Project
=================================================

This Yocto support package provides a base layer meta-iot-gateway
and a supplemental layer meta-greengrass for building IoT Gateway
Linux images on top of the standard i.MX BSP. The base layer adds basic
features like WiFi routing, access point and client capabilities, as
well as various application support packages like python, txthings
and nodejs. The supplemental layer meta-greengrass adds an AWS
Greengrass core to the image.

The images are tested specifically on NXP i.MX 6UltraLite EVK and
i.MX 6UltraLowLite EVK platforms.

Quick Start
-----------
To setup the BSP you need to have `repo` installed. Install the `repo` utility:

$ mkdir ~/bin
$ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$ PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Create the BSP directory:

$ mkdir imx-iot-gateway
$ cd imx-iot-gateway
$ repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-rocko -m imx-4.9.88-2.0.0-iotg-greengrass-demo.xml

Download the BSP:

$ repo sync

Create the build directory for a base build or for a Greengrass
build, with <machine> = imx6ulevk (default) or imx6ull14x14evk:

$ cd imx-iot-gateway
$ [MACHINE=<machine>] . setup-iot-gateway | setup-greengrass <build-dir>

If the build directory exists but you're in a new shell, run the
setup script again to setup your shell. The build folder will
be unaffected:

$ cd imx-iot-gateway
$ [MACHINE=<machine>] . setup-iot-gateway | setup-greengrass <build-dir>

Download the Greengrass core software and security certificates:

If you're working with Greengrass, you'll need to download two files
from the AWS IoT console:
- greengrass-linux-armv7l-1.3.0.tar.gz - the AWS Greengrass core software,
  version 1.3.0
- GUID-setup.tar.gz - security certificates enabling secure communications
  with the AWS IoT cloud and config.json which contains configuration
  information specific to your AWS Greengrass core and the AWS IoT endpoint

Copy the core software to your build environment sources folder. The setup-greengrass
script sets GG_TARBALL_LOCAL_PATH to this location in your local.conf:

$ cp ~/greengrass-linux-armv7l-1.3.0.tar.gz imx-iot-gateway/sources

Build the image:

$ cd imx-iot-gateway/<build-dir>
$ bitbake imx-image-iot-gateway

Greengrass Tutorial
-------------------
If you're working with Greengrass, you should now have everything you
need to run the tutorial [1]. You can skip Module 1 since the image
is already configured to run the Greengrass core.

Note that if you are unable to deploy the Greengrass configuration [2], 
you may need to adjust your local network.

[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html
[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/configs-core.html

In Module 2, you do not need to copy the core software, it is already installed
in the image. You will need to follow the instructions for copying the
security certificates in GUID-setup.tar.gz that you downloaded earlier.

Ethernet
--------
For the 4.9.11-1.0.0 release, a bug was introduced that prevents
the system from automatically establishing a network connection
over Ethernet. This can be corrected by executing the following
commands on the console:

root@imx6ulevk:~# systemctl unmask connman
root@imx6ulevk:~# systemctl enable connman
root@imx6ulevk:~# systemctl start connman

WiFi
----
Some instructions for enabling WiFi:

In the boot console, update the dtb, with <dtb-proc> = imx6ul or imx6ull:

$ setenv fdt_file <dtb-proc>-14x14-evk-btwifi.dtb
$ saveenv
$ boot

In the shell console, configure the board as a WiFi client:

$ ifconfig wlan0 up
$ wpa_passphrase <wifi-network> <wifi-password> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
$ wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D nl80211
$ udhcpc -i wlan0
